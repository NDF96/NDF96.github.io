	<p> I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, where I work under the supervision of Prof. George Pappas.<br>
		My research interest is at the intersection of <strong> communication networks, control and machine learning</strong>.
			The goal of my research is to contribute to the <strong>methodological foundations</strong>
			for the real-world development of the next generation of <strong>distributed and multi-agent autonomous 
				systems.</strong> Engineering-wise, I am very interested in <strong>communication efficiency</strong>: 
				how can multiple agents coordinate with minimal communication cost to 
				achieve a certain objective? How can we design communication and control protocols accordingly?
				 Application-wise, I have recently been working intensively 
				on environmental monitoring in the context of <strong>underwater robotics</strong>,
				 which to me represents a stimulating and challenging frontier of engineering and science. </p>
	<p>
		I obtained my PhD from University of Padova, where I was advised by Prof. Luca Schenato and co-advised by Prof. Michele Rossi. 
		During my PhD, my focus has been on studying the designs and properties of frameworks in which multiple agents cooperate to solve 
		a machine learning (ML) or reinforcement learning (RL) problem by communicating with a central coordinator, in what is called the 
		Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Some of the research questions I tried to answer have been: can we get superlinear convergence 
		in FL in a communication-efficient way? Is cooperation beneficial in federated RL when communication is subject to constraints? 
		The typical fields of application of these studies are, for example, in large-scale distributed ML, FL over wireless networks, 
		ML and RL algorithms trained from decentralized data at the network edge and 6G systems. </p>
